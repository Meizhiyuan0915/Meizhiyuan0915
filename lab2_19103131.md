# 2 Program Requirements

1. Basic requirement: output "keyword" statistics
2. Advanced requirement: output the number of "switch case" structures, and output the number of "case" corresponding to each group
3. Uplifting requirement: output the number of "if else" structures
4. Ultimate requirement: output the number of "if, else if, else" structures

# 3 idea

git and git hub:

This is probably my first time using Git, So I learned everything about Git from Runoob.
https://www.runoob.com/git/git-remote-repo.html

task:

First, I need to make the general whole structure, using "readlines" and strip() to make the lines list clean with having no space in the front of the string.

Then I put all the words into a list and compare with the keywords list.

For "Switch Case" structures, I marked "switch "and stopped marking at the end of this "switch case". In this way I can get the number of "switch" and "cases".

I might have to do something special with the "if else" structure. I can tell if it's an "if else" structure by the order between "if" and "else" and other keywords.

For the "if else-if else" structure, I added the interception of "{" and"} "in a similar way to the" switch case ". Determine how many "if else-if else" structures there are by the position of "if", "else", "{" and"}".

Start with this idea, I use with open(filename, 'r') to read files so that we don't need to close that.

# 5 The process of solving the problem

## Extraction of files

```python
with open("lll.txt","r") as f:          #读取文件
    lines = f.readlines()
    #将文件中所有的单词提取出来

    for line in lines:                  #每一行
        line = line.strip()     #消除每行前后面的空格
        line = line.replace("#","")
        print(line)    #验证最后的元素的样子
```

## Level 1 command

```python
    for n in range(0,len(line)):       #在line长度之内

        if (line[n]==alphabet[j]):       #line中某个元素是26个小写字母
            str1=str1+line[n]               #将line中的每个字母写入一个string当作单词
            print(line[n])
            print(str1)
            n+=1                        #下一位
            j=0

        elif j+1==26:                  #不是26个小写字母
            words[b]=str1

            str1=''             #重置string
            b+=1
            j=0                        #将j初始化
            n+=1                      #继续遍历
        elif (j+1)!=26:              #还没找到26中的一个
            # 下一个字母
            j+=1

for word in words:
     for key in keywords:
         if word == key:
            count+=1

print("number of keyword is: ",count)
```

## Level 2 command

```python
# 二级命令
with open("lll.txt","r") as f:          #读取文件
    lines = f.readlines()
    #将文件中所有的单词提取出来
    switchNum = 0
    caseNum = 0
    case = []
    key1 = 'switch'
    key2 = 'case'
    space = 0
    num = 0

    for line in lines:
        num += 1
        space = line.find(key1)
        if space != -1:
            for line in lines[num:]:
                if line.find(key2) != -1:  # 当找到了“case”，是正确的，不等于-1
                    caseNum += 1
                if line.find('}') == space:
                    switchNum += 1
                    case.append(caseNum)
                    caseNum = 0
                    break
```

## Level 3&4 command

```python
#三级命令
num = 0
ifElseNum = 0
ifElseifElseNum = 0

with open("lll.txt","r") as f:          #读取文件
    lines = f.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        num += 1
        if 'if' in line and 'else if' not in line:
            ifSpace = line.find('if')

            for line in lines[num:]:
                if 'else' in line and ifSpace == line.find('else'):
                    if 'else if' in line:

                        ifElseifElseNum+= 1
                    else:

                        ifElseNum += 1
                    break
    print(totalNum, switchNum, case, ifElseNum, ifElseifElseNum)

#四级命令
with open("lll.txt","r") as f:          #读取文件
    lines = f.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        num += 1
        if 'if' in line and 'else if' not in line:
            ifSpace = line.find('if')

            for line in lines[num:]:
                if 'else' in line and ifspace == line.find('else'):
                    if 'else if' in line:

                        ifElseifElseNum += 1
                    else:

                        ifElseNum+= 1
                    break
    print(totalNum, switchNum, case, ifElseNum, ifElseifElseNum)
```

# 5 The Summary

In this project, I reviewed the knowledge of python and used it to complete the task. I believe there's still something wrong and imperfect, but the technique is always improving now.

The most difficult thing I found is to keep the whole structure right.
